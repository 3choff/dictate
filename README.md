# Dictate

![Dictate Demo](https://github.com/3choff/dictate/blob/main/assets/demo/demo.gif?raw=true)

Dictate is a high-performance desktop dictation application for Windows built with Tauri and Rust, inspired by the familiar UI of Windows Voice Typing. It delivers powerful speech-to-text capabilities with minimal resource usage, allowing users to record audio, transcribe it in real-time, and seamlessly insert the transcription into any active application. With features like global hotkeys, audio cues, and voice commands, Dictate streamlines your workflow and boosts productivity.

If Dictate improves your workflow, please consider supporting ongoing AI memberships and inference costs via

**Version:** 1.8.0
**All changes are documented in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.**

> **Note:** The legacy Electron-based version (v0.6.7) is available in the `electron-legacy` branch.

## Features

*   **Desktop Dictation:** Record your voice and have it transcribed into text.
*   **Seamless Text Insertion:** Automatically pastes or types the transcribed text into your active application.
*   **Standalone Windows Executable:** Packaged as a portable `.exe` for easy distribution and use.
*   **Interactive Settings:** Configure API keys, transcription services (Deepgram, Cartesia, Groq, Gemini, Mistral, SambaNova, Fireworks), text rewrite provider and mode (Groq, Gemini, Mistral, SambaNova, Fireworks), transcription language, and text insertion modes through a dedicated settings window.
*   **Help & Support:** Quick access to the project's GitHub page via a help button.
*   **Global Keyboard Shortcuts:** System-wide shortcuts for recording, text rewrite, compact mode, and more (see [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) section).
*   **Text Rewrite:** Select any text in any app and click the sparkle button (or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`) to rewrite it using your chosen mode and AI provider. Choose from Grammar Correction, Professional Tone, Polite Tone, Casual Tone, or Structured & Organized (default: Grammar Correction with Groq). Click again while pulsing to abort.
*   **Audio Cues:** Audible "beep" on starting recording and "clack" on stopping recording for clear feedback.
*   **Multiple Transcription Services:**
    *   **Groq:** ML-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD) with intelligent speech segmentation.
    *   **Deepgram:** Real-time streaming transcription for lower latency.
    *   **Cartesia:** Real-time streaming transcription using a dedicated PCM pipeline.
    *   **Gemini:** ML-based VAD with intelligent speech segmentation.
    *   **Mistral:** ML-based VAD with intelligent speech segmentation.
    *   **SambaNova:** ML-based VAD with intelligent speech segmentation.
    *   **Fireworks:** ML-based VAD with intelligent speech segmentation.
*   **Intelligent Speech Segmentation:** Uses Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection) ML model for accurate speech detection:
    *   Automatically trims silence before and after speech
    *   Ignores keyboard/mouse noise and background sounds
    *   Configurable silence threshold (400ms default)
    *   No false positives from non-speech audio
    *   Complete utterances preserved with smart buffering
*   **Multilingual Understanding:** Pick a default transcription language in settings. Providers that accept language hints receive it automatically; leaving the selector on `Multilingual` falls back to each provider's auto-detect mode.
    * Deepgram streams with `language=multi`.
    * Groq Whisper (whisper-large-v3-turbo) auto-detects language.
    * Gemini Flash Lite handles multilingual audio.
    * Mistral Voxtral receives the selected language when provided.
    * SambaNova Whisper receives the selected language when provided.
*   **Text Formatting Control:** Single "Text formatted" setting controls output:
    * Non‑streaming providers (Groq, Gemini, Mistral): when unchecked, the app normalizes transcript (lowercase + removes punctuation). When checked, transcript is preserved.
    * Streaming provider (Deepgram): toggles the `smart_format` request parameter to match the setting.
*   **Flexible Text Insertion:** Choose between native Windows SendKeys or clipboard-based insertion for compatibility.
*   **Voice Commands:** Execute rich text manipulation actions (e.g., "press enter", "backspace", "delete that", "select all", "press rewrite") and system shortcuts entirely through voice, with an in-app toggle to enable or disable them. Commands now apply consistently to both streaming and non-streaming providers.

### Window Views

Right-click anywhere on the main window to quickly toggle between the compact and expanded layouts.

### Recording and Transcribing

1.  **Launch Dictate.**
2.  **Start Recording:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` to start recording (see [Keyboard Shortcuts](#keyboard-shortcuts) for all available shortcuts). You will hear a "beep" sound.
3.  **Speak:** Dictate your text.
4.  **Stop Recording:** Press `Ctrl+Shift+D` again to stop recording or say "stop listening". You will hear a "clack" sound.
5.  **Text Insertion:** The transcribed text will automatically be pasted into your currently active application.
   * Groq, Mistral, SambaNova, Fireworks, Gemini: Speak, pause ~1s to emit a segment; text is inserted per segment.
   * Deepgram and Cartesia: Inserts finalized phrases as they arrive in streaming mode.

### Settings

Click the gear icon in the Dictate window to open the settings. Here you can:
*   Enter your API keys for Groq, Deepgram, Cartesia, Gemini, Mistral, SambaNova, and Fireworks.
*   Select your preferred transcription service and transcription language (or leave `Multilingual`).
*   Configure text rewrite settings:
    *   Choose rewrite mode: Grammar Correction, Professional Tone, Polite Tone, Casual Tone, or Structured & Organized
    *   Select AI provider: Groq GPT-OSS-120B, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite, Mistral Small, Llama-3.3-70B, or Fireworks GPT-OSS-20B (Default: Groq)
*   Choose your text insertion mode (Simulated Typing via SendKeys or Clipboard paste).
*   Toggle "Text formatted" to control normalized vs. formatted output for both providers (Groq normalization, Deepgram `smart_format`).

### Voice Commands

Dictate supports several voice commands for hands-free text manipulation. The full list of available commands is defined in `src-tauri/src/voice_commands.rs` and applies consistently across all providers (streaming and batch). Here are a few examples:

*   **Punctuation:** "period" (.), "comma" (,), "question mark" (?)
*   **Key Presses:** "press enter", "backspace", "press space", "press tab"
*   **Control Combinations:** "press control plus c" (Ctrl+C), "press control plus v" (Ctrl+V)
*   **Text Manipulation:** "delete that" (removes the most recent word), "select all" (Ctrl+A)
*   **Text Rewrite:** "press rewrite" (selects all text and runs the text rewrite shortcut with current mode)
*   **Dictation Controls:** "pause voice typing", "stop dictation", "pause voice mode", etc. (sends Ctrl+Shift+D to pause voice typing)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Dictate provides global keyboard shortcuts that work from anywhere on your system. **All shortcuts are fully customizable** - you can change them to your preferred key combinations in the Settings window under the "Shortcuts" tab:

| Shortcut | Function | Description |

## Acknowledgements

This project incorporates the Silero VAD (Voice Activity Detection) implementation from the [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) project by cjpais. The VAD module provides intelligent speech segmentation using machine learning, significantly improving transcription accuracy by filtering out non-speech audio and properly detecting speech boundaries.

The VAD integration includes:
- Silero VAD model for ML-based speech detection
- SmoothedVad wrapper with onset detection, hangover, and prefill buffering
- Async session management for non-blocking audio processing

Thank you to the Handy project for the excellent VAD implementation!
