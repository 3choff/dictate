   - **Mitigation**: Use clipboard as fallback, test extensively

3. **Streaming Providers**
   - **Risk**: WebSocket complexity in Rust
   - **Mitigation**: Use proven libraries, test incrementally

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Voice Command Accuracy**
   - **Mitigation**: Port exact logic from Electron, extensive testing

2. **UI Pixel-Perfect Match**
   - **Mitigation**: Use same CSS values, side-by-side comparison
