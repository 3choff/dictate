---

## Electron Legacy Versions (0.x.x)

The following versions represent the legacy Electron-based implementation, available in the `electron/` directory.

## [0.6.7] - 2025-10-04

### Changed
- Optimized build configuration to include only required dependencies, reducing bundle size and improving startup performance.
- Enabled ASAR packaging for faster file I/O and compressed app code.

### Removed
- Unused dependencies (`express`, `multer`) that were inflating the build size.

## [0.6.6] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Global shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V` toggles between compact and expanded window layouts.
- Compact mode preference is now persisted and restored on launch, so the window reopens in the last chosen view.

## [0.6.5] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- Automated version sync (`npm run sync-doc-version`) now reads the latest entry in `CHANGELOG.md` and updates both `package.json` and `README.md` to match.

### Changed
- Settings label now calls the non-clipboard mode "Simulated Typing (SendKeys)" to clarify the behavior.

### Fixed
- Taskbar icon is hidden immediately when the window closes, eliminating orphaned entries.
- Window position persistence now saves during movement only, improving shutdown responsiveness.

## [0.6.4] - 2025-09-28

### Added

### Changed
- Main window launches at the default size but restores your last on-screen position to stay out of the way between sessions.

### Fixed
- Voice command rearraged and removed duplicated commands.

## [0.6.3] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- Deepgram streaming now always loads the provider bundle (`src/shared/providers/deepgram.js`) and forwards the selected language or `multi` plus `endpointing=100` for reliable multilingual transcripts.

### Changed
- Main window is created with `focusable: false`, so clicking Dictate no longer steals focus from the target application while issuing commands.

### Fixed
- Non-ASCII characters are now handled correctly in native injection using the clipboard fallback.

## [0.6.2] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- Smooth compact/expanded window transitions and state animations in `src/renderer/main/styles.css` for a more polished layout switch.
- Optional system tray support (currently commented) that can be re-enabled via `setupTray()` to provide quick access without the main window.

### Changed
- Main window now uses the bundled `assets/icon/icon.ico`, so the Windows taskbar shows the Dictate glyph instead of the default Electron icon.
- Default window styling keeps the dark theme consistent during mode switches by harmonizing body padding and background settings.

## [0.6.1] - 2025-09-27

### Changed
- Windows now wait for their renderers to finish loading before displaying, eliminating the white flash on the main and settings windows.
- Electron windows explicitly use the app's dark theme background color to prevent flicker during startup.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- Real-time Cartesia streaming provider with manual PCM audio pipeline and settings UI selection.

### Changed
- Extracted `settings.js` and `index.js` to remove inline scripts from renderer HTML files, improving maintainability.
- Settings provider API key inputs are now generated dynamically from a single configuration.

### Fixed
- Voice commands (pause dictation, grammar correction, etc.) now also work for streaming providers by routing transcripts through `processAndInject()`.

## [0.5.1] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- Persist main window position and size across launches, restoring to the last location within the active display work area.

### Changed
- Cleanup timer-based saving of main window bounds when the window moves or resizes to reduce disk writes.

### Fixed
- Prevent main window from reopening off-screen by clamping saved bounds to the current monitor.

## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-27

### Added
- Voice command phrases for "select all" (Ctrl+A), grammar correction macro, and pausing dictation (Ctrl+Shift+D).

### Changed
- Voice commands can now be toggled via settings and the parser respects the toggle in both injection flows.
- Grammar correction voice commands trigger select-all before running the shortcut to ensure the provider works on the current text.

### Fixed
- "Delete that" voice command removes the last spoken word reliably and no longer reinserts the command text.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-09-27

### Changed
- Settings window now positions itself relative to available screen space (prefers left, then right, below, above) instead of always shifting left.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-26

### Added
- Transcription language selector in the settings window with support for multilingual fallback.

### Changed

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project adheres to Semantic Versioning (SemVer): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## [0.1.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added
- Settings: Insertion Mode dropdown to choose between Clipboard (paste) and Native (SendKeys).
- Settings: Provider-specific API keys with eye-toggle inside the input to show/hide the key.
- Deepgram: Streaming transcription path with nova-3 defaults and configurable encoding based on MediaRecorder support.
- Voice Commands: Centralized `src/shared/voice-commands.js` with punctuation and key commands, plus "delete that" to remove last word.
- Packaging: Fallback loading for audio cues (beep/clack) via base64 or file URL.
- Asset discovery in packaged apps checks both `resources/assets/...` (extraResources) and `resources/app/assets/...` (bundled) paths.

### Changed
- Centralized Deepgram WebSocket URL builder and defaults in `src/shared/deepgram.js`.
- `insert-text` handler: parses and executes commands, inserts remaining text using the chosen insertion mode, and ensures trailing space between segments.
